# Week6Lab

The program takes a string as an input (n) and a non-zero number. The program will print the string |n| times, but the string will be backwards if n is negative. If n is input as zero, the program will output an error message.

To install the program, simply download the .py file and run in. Follow the prompts and enter the required information, then hit enter. The program will then output the results.

This program has many uses for anytime you need a string printed several times, either backwards or forwards.

To contribute to this project, simply open the file on the github repository and click fork in the top right corner. After you have made changes, simply submit a pull request.
